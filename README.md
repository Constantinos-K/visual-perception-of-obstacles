## Abstract

<p align="justify">
Contemporary cities are fractured by a growing number of barriers, such as on-going construction and infrastructure
damages, which endanger pedestrian safety. Automated detection and recognition of such barriers from visual data has
been of particular concern to the research community in recent years. Deep Learning (DL) algorithms are now
the dominant approach in visual data analysis, achieving excellent results in a wide range of applications,
including obstacle detection. However, explaining the underlying operations of DL models remains a key challenge in
gaining significant understanding on how they arrive at their decisions.The use of heatmaps that highlight the focal
points in input images that helped the models reach their predictions has emerged as a form of post-hoc explainability
for such models. In an effort to gain insights into the learning process of DL models, we studied the similarities
between heatmaps generated by a number of DL model architectures trained to detect obstacles on sidewalks in images
collected via smartphones, and eye-tracking heatmaps generated by humans as they detect the corresponding obstacles
on the same data. Our findings indicate that the focus points of humans more closely align with those of a Vision
Transformer architecture, as opposed to the other network architectures we examined in our experiments.
